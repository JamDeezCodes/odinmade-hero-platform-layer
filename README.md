# Odinmade Hero Platform Layer

A platform layer inspired by Casey Muratori's [Handmade Hero series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee3EtYb8d1o), written in the Odin programming language.

You may use this repo to quickly start making games the "Handmade" way with sound output, hot code reloading, and gameplay input/state recording/playback.

### Setup

Install the [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) programming language.

This project uses Odin's [vendored SDL2 package](https://pkg.odin-lang.org/vendor/sdl2/) and the implementation follows [Handmade Penguin](https://davidgow.net/handmadepenguin/default.html).

### Run Odinmade Hero

Execute the build script and run the executable on Windows:
```cmd
.\build.bat & .\build\odinmade.exe
```

Execute the build script and run the executable on Darwin:
```bash
sh build.sh && build/odinmade.bin
```

### TODO
* Linux build instructions/scripts
